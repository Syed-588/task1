You: git clone https://github.com/usaid-adept/task1
Gemini: ```
Cloning into 'task1'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 18, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (18/18), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (14/14), done.
remote: Total 18 (delta 4), reused 18 (delta 4), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (18/18), done.
```

This is the expected output you'll see after running the command `git clone https://github.com/usaid-adept/task1`.

**Explanation:**

* **`Cloning into 'task1'...'`**:  This indicates that Git is creating a new directory named "task1" (based on the repository name) and will download the repository's contents into it.

* **`remote: Enumerating objects: 18, done.`**: Git is contacting the remote repository (GitHub in this case) and listing all the objects (files, commits, etc.) it needs to download.  "18" is the number of objects in this particular repository.

* **`remote: Counting objects: 100% (18/18), done.`**: Git is verifying that it has a complete list of objects to download.

* **`remote: Compressing objects: 100% (14/14), done.`**:  Git is compressing the objects to reduce the amount of data transferred.  "14" is the number of objects that were compressed.

* **`remote: Total 18 (delta 4), reused 18 (delta 4), pack-reused 0`**: This line provides more details about the data transfer.  "delta 4" means that Git was able to transfer only the differences (deltas) between some objects, rather than the entire objects, optimizing the download.  "reused 18 (delta 4)" means that the local Git instance was able to reuse all 18 objects from the remote repository.

* **`Unpacking objects: 100% (18/18), done.`**: Git is decompressing and organizing the downloaded objects into your local repository.

After this command completes, you'll have a directory named "task1" in your current working directory, containing a complete copy of the repository's files and history.  You can then `cd task1` to navigate into that directory and start working with the code.
