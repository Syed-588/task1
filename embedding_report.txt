Embedding & Similarity Report

What are Sentence Embeddings?

Sentence embeddings turn a sentence into numbers so a computer can understand and compare them. These numbers represent the meaning of the sentence.

In this project, I used a model called "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" from a library called Sentence-Transformers. It changes each sentence into a list of numbers.

 What is Cosine Similarity?

Cosine similarity is a way to compare two sentences (as vectors). It gives a number between:
- 1.0 (very similar)
- 0.0 (not similar at all)

How I Used It in My Project

When the user types a message:
1. The chatbot saves the message to a file called chat_history.txt
2. It gets all previous user messages from that file
3. It changes all those messages, and the new one, into vectors (lists of numbers)
4. It compares the new message to the old ones using cosine similarity
5. It shows the similarity score in the chatbot

Example:

You: Hello  
Gemini: Hi there! How can I help you today?  
(Similarity to earlier messages: 1.00)

You: Tell me a joke  
Gemini: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!  
(Similarity to earlier messages: 0.23)

Why This Is Useful

This helps the bot know if you're saying something similar to what you said before. It's a simple way to make the bot a little smarter.
